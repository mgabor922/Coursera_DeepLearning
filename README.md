# Deep Learning Assignments

This is a collection of the completed python notebooks for the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. These courses helped me understand
the basic intuitions of deep learning and I wanted to save the solutions for later revision.

## Getting Started

The folder structure is as follows:
  - Course name
    - Week of the course
      - Name of the assignment
        - Python notebook
